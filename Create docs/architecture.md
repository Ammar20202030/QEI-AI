# QEI-AI Runtime Layer

The QEI-AI Runtime is the deterministic execution core responsible for
coordinating spectral stability, silicon-aware constraints, and governance rules.

## Core Responsibilities

- Deterministic state transitions  
- Stability enforcement using multi-layer spectral factors  
- Silicon-aware execution timing  
- Signed operational steps with verifiable logs  
- Execution of cognitive modules under strict invariants  

## Runtime Invariants

The runtime guarantees:

1. No execution step without a signed directive  
2. No state transition without spectral validation  
3. No model response without stability scoring  
4. Full auditability of all operations  

## Runtime Inputs

- Stability factors (FSF, SSF, LTF, QTF)  
- Session parameters  
- Hardware-level telemetry  
- User directive context  

## Runtime Outputs

- Controlled, validated inference results  
- Updated spectral signatures  
- Verifiable execution logs
