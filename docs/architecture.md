# QEI-AI Architecture Overview

This document provides a public high-level overview of the QEI-AI engineered intelligence system, focusing on structure, layers, interfaces, and operational guarantees — without exposing proprietary internals.

## System Overview

QEI-AI operates as a deterministic, multi-layer engineered intelligence runtime designed around:

- Silicon-aware execution  
- Spectral stability layers  
- Deterministic state management  
- Verifiable cognitive transitions  
- Multi-agent orchestration under strict governance

More detailed architectural diagrams and subsystem explanations will be added in subsequent revisions.
